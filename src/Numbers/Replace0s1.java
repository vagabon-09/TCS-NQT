Input: N = 102003
Output: 112113
Explanation: The 2nd,4th and 5th position from left contain 0.The resultant integer has replaced the 0â€™s in those  positions with 1.

Example 2:
Input:  204
Output: 214
Explanation: The 2nd position from left contain 0. The resultant integer has replaced the 0 in that position with 1.
